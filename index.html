    <div class="why">
      <h3>Why I chose programming</h3>
      <p>I chose programming because I have always wanted to be a developer, whether it would be developing apps, websites, or video games. I love the ability to start from a blank canvas and create something that you envision. I love all the miniscule details and perfectionism of prgramming and being able to bounce ideas off of classmates or co-workers is amazing.</p>
